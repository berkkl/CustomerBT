This repository contains a prototype implementation of a Behavior Tree for simulating customer behavior in a restaurant environment. The implementation is designed for use in Unity and includes custom scripts to manage various customer actions, such as moving to a table, ordering a meal, eating, paying for the meal, and exiting the restaurant.

Here is a GIF for Customer
